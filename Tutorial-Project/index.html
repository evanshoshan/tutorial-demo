        <p>React is a front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook to 
            allow developers to create reusable UI components. 
            <br /><br />
            It is currently one of the most popular JavaScript libraries and has a strong foundation and large community behind it. 
            <br /> <br />
            This tutorial will describe the basic knowledge needed to dive into React for the first time. I will presume that you have
            a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While React does not use HTML, it uses JSX which is very similar and has the same 
            underlying principals. 
        </p>
        <!-- <br /> <br /> <br />
        <h2>Basic Terminology</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Compnonet:
                </li>
                <li>
                    DOM:
                </li>
                <li>
                    JSX:
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p> -->
    </div>

    <div id="Setup" class="section">
        <h2 class="heading">Setup</h2>
        <p>
            Setting up a React project requires a great deal of configuration. For the purpose of this tutorial we will use something called 
            <span class="keyword">create-react-app</span> to create this application. This is a command line utility that allows you to get 
            a react project setup and running with little configuration required.
            <br /> <br />
            Now in order to use this command line utility you must first install <span class="keyword">node.js</span> onto your computer. This
            can be done by heading to <a href="nodejs.org">nodejs.org</a> and installing the most recent stable version. After it has been installed,
            you must install the <span class="keyword">create-react-app</span> package onto your computer. Open a command prompt window and type:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
            <code>
                    npm install -g create-react-app
            </code>
        </div>
        <p>
            This installs the dependencies (globally) needed to use React and allows you to create your first application. Using the command prompt,
            navigate to the directory you want to create in and use the command:
        </p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    create-react-app my-app
                </code>
            </div>
        <p>
            You have created your first React project....Congrats! Now lets dive in and start building the <a href="http://tutorial-demo.surge.sh">React demo app</a>. 
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Instructions" class="section">
        <h2 class="heading">Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            As soon as you begin downloading dependencies, you will notice that there is a new folder in the directory you choose.
            <br /> Once its done, your command prompt you should display instructions from React on how to begin.

        </p>
        <img src="img/screenshot_create.png" class="tutorialPic">
        <p>
            Lets follow these instructions and see what happens. First, we will cd to the my-app. And then run <span class="keyword">npm start</span>.
        </p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>
                    cd my-app
                    <br /> npm start
                </code>
            </div>
        <p>
            As you can see, it launches a live server, in this case localhost:3000 and displays a react splash screen telling you to edit 
            <span class="keyword">src/App.js</span> and reload.
        </p>
        <image src="img/screenshot_blankApp.png" class="tutorialPic" style="border:1px solid white"></image>
        <p>
            Now its time to start editing the app. Open the new folder that was created in any text editor. I use Visual Studio Code but any editor will 
            work fine. After opening the project, you will see that there are several files and folders that were auto created. 
        </p>
        <table id="table">
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <image src="img/screenshot_files.png" class="tutorialPic" style="border:1px solid white; width:230px;float:right;"></image>
                </td>
                <td style="vertical-align:text-top;text-align: left;">
                    <p>
                        The <span class="keyword">node_modules</span> folder contains all the dependencies that React requires to run your app. <br /><br />
                        Inside the <span class="keyword">src</span> folder is a number of files. The first being <span class="keyword">App.css</span>. 
                        For this project we will delete everything inside this file as we will add our own styling later. <br /><br />
                        We will do the same thing for <span class="keyword">App.js</span> as we want to work with a blank slate.<br /> <br />
                        <span class="keyword">App.test.js</span> is included for testing but we wont go into that here so just leave it be. <br /> <br />
                        <span class="keyword">Index.css</span> and <span class="keyword">Index.js</span> are both important files that we will go into later,
                        so again, just leave them for now.<br /><br />
                        The <span class="keyword">logo.svg</span> is the logo that was spinning on the react splash screen. We no longer need this file so you can
                        delete it.
                    </p>
                    
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
            Now that you know about the files lets go ahead and create a react component. To start we will create a <span class="keyword">components</span>
            folder inside the <span class="keyword">src</span> folder. This will house all the components we create and will be the building blocks for the 
            site. 
            <br />For this project we will have three components: <span class="keyword">Form</span>, <span class="keyword">Title</span>, and <span class="keyword">Weather</span>.
            Below is the code for each of the three components.
            <br /> <br />
        </p>
            <div>
                <image src="img/screenshot_weather.png" class="gallery"></image>
                <image src="img/screenshot_titles.png" class="gallery"></image>
                <image src="img/screenshot_form.png" class="gallery"></image>
            </div>
        <p>
            There are several things to notice in the above code. For one, all the component classes start with <span class="keyword">import React from 'react';</span>.
            This is required and tells the file to import the React object from the package. Once react is imported, you then have to initialize a react component. <br />This is
            done with <span class="keyword">Class [name] extends React.Component{}</span>. Inside of this class we have to declare what data will go inside of this component. 
            We do this by using the  <span class="keyword">render()</span> method. The code inside the render class looks like HTML however it is actually JSX. 
            <br />JSX code inside the render method is converted to JavaScript behind the scenes.
            <br /><br />
            There is one more thing to notice inside the component files and that is the  <span class="keyword">Export default [name];</span> tag at the bottom of each class. This
            exports the component so that it becomes available for other components to import.
            <br />
            <br />
            The next part of this application is making an API call to a URL. The URL we will be using is: <a href="www.openweathermap.org/api">www.openweathermap.org/api</a>. To do this, you must first 
            make an account and register for an API KEY. This is free and fairly simple to do. The actual call to the API will be done in the  <span class="keyword">App.js</span> file. We will do this 
            by creating a method inside of <span class="keyword">App.js</span> called <span class="keyword">getWeather()</span>.
        </p>
        <image src="img/screenshot_getWeather.png" class="tutorialPic"></image>
        <p>
            Now that the app is getting the weather. All we have left to do is render the components together and display the information. We will do this in two ways. First, we will use something
            called <span class="keyword">state</span> to store the properties of the API call and send it to the weather compoenent. Then we will use the render method in <span class="keyword">App.js</span>
            to render the final output. Below is the code for each of these methods.
        </p>
        <div>
            <image src="img/screenshot_state.png" class="gallery2"></image>
            <image src="img/screenshot_render.png" class="gallery2"></image>
        </div>
        <p>
            Now that everything is rendered. We can add in our CSS styling to make the page look professional and attractive. This is done by first importing bootstrap into the application. You import
            bootstrap the same way that you would import any other component. Inside of <span class="keyword">index.js</span> add the line: 
        </p>
            <div class="code" style="width: 375px;"> 
                <code>
                    import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
                </code>
            </div>
        <p>
            That adds in the bootstrap CDN to the file. Since we used the bootstrap classes in the <span class="keyword">render()</span> methods, adding the stylesheets are enough to include basic elements
            in the application. We will supplement these bootstrap styles with out own by adding the following to <span class="keyword">App.css</span>:
        </p>
        <div>
                <image src="img/screenshot_css1.png" class="gallery"></image>
                <image src="img/screenshot_css2.png" class="gallery"></image>
            </div>
    </div>
